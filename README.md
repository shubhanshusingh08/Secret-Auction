# Secret-Auction
A python based auction program.

Description:
You are asked to enter your name and he bid amount and then asked if there are other persons to bid or not.
If there are other persons it will clear out the screen containing the name and bid amount of the previous person and then ask the new person to enter the same credentials.
The game will go on as long as there are more bidders. 
Once you enter no on being asked about more bidders, the program will return you the name of the person and bid amount who has the highest bid.
